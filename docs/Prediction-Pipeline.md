# Predict Pipeline

## Introduction

This document focuses on the data ingestion process as part of the predict pipeline, specifically for making predictions using a trained machine learning model. Data ingestion is crucial for preparing the input data and making predictions. This process is implemented in the `PredictPipeline` class.

## Code Structure

The data ingestion process is part of the predict pipeline, which includes model loading and preprocessing. The relevant components are as follows:

- **PredictPipeline**: A class responsible for loading a trained model and preprocessing data for making predictions.

- **CustomData**: A class that represents input data for making predictions.

## Data Ingestion Steps

### 1. Model and Preprocessor Loading

The data ingestion process starts with the `PredictPipeline`. It performs the following steps:

- **Loading Model**: The code loads the trained machine learning model from a specified file path, typically saved during the model training process.

- **Loading Preprocessor**: The code also loads a preprocessing object, which was saved during data transformation. This object is used to preprocess the input data before making predictions.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Once the model and preprocessing object are loaded, the data preprocessing process begins. This involves:

- **Input Data Creation**: The `CustomData` class is used to create input data for making predictions. It encapsulates various input features required for predictions, such as meal type, room type, lead time, and more.

- **Data Transformation**: The input data is transformed into a DataFrame, making it compatible with the preprocessing object. The DataFrame has the same structure as the data used during model training.

- **Preprocessing**: The loaded preprocessing object is applied to the input data, performing operations like feature encoding and scaling.

### 3. Prediction

With preprocessed data, the code uses the loaded model to make predictions. The output is a prediction or a classification result based on the input data.

## Usage

To use the predict pipeline for making predictions, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the `PredictPipeline` class.

2. Call the `predict(features)` method on the instance, providing the input data as a dictionary of feature values. The features must match the structure used during model training.

3. The method performs data ingestion and preprocessing, and returns predictions based on the loaded model.

## Conclusion

The data ingestion process in the predict pipeline is a crucial step in preparing and preprocessing data for making predictions with a trained machine learning model. This document provides an overview of the data ingestion process within the context of the predict pipeline.

This document offers insights into the data ingestion process within the predict pipeline, facilitating a better understanding of how input data is prepared and preprocessed before making predictions.
